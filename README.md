## About

This project is my third submission towards my interniship with Oasis Infobyte.

This app is a To-Do app which allows users to add tasks and swipe them once they are complete to mark them as complete. The app also allows users to sign in using their email and password and stores their tasks in a Firebase database. The app also allows users to sign out.
